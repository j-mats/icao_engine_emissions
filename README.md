# ICAO Aicraft Engine Emissions Study

A look into the Aircraft Engine Emission tests to analyse and see if I can find out which engines might be less environment-friendly or efficient among the different models of engines. It consists of some data expolration and unsuperviserd clustering in an attempt to identify more environment-friendly engines as it is now our turn to look after our planet and ensure we don't destroy it.

This project was done as part of the final step to my training program for data science.

The data for this project was obtained from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedeltom/icao-aircraft-engine-emissions.
